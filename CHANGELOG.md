## 0.1.0

- BLE connection to ELM327/STN UART adapters (scan, bond, GATT, MTU, teardown).
- Serialized command session with framing, overflow handling, resync and a quiet
  period before the first command of a replacing session.
- Two-layer guard: library hard guard (read-only services, adapter allow-list,
  VIN and ECU serial always rejected) plus a caller-supplied `CommandPolicy`,
  enforced by the `ObdBridge` facade.
- Foreground recording service with reconnect/backoff, optional wake lock and a
  crash-safe JSONL buffer with configurable format identifier.
- ELM/ISO-TP response parser and a module-setup builder.
